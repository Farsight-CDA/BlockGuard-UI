{ Introducing BlockGuard }

[hier ne aufgemotze powerpoint wäre cool]
{BlockGuard is a VPN service that works on the Akash network.

It doesn't require an account or subscription and works on all your devices.

VPN usage has skyrocketed since 2020 and is expected to reach 353 million users by 2022.

But. [wenn du ne grafic findes kannst du sie gerne einfügen]

Unlike traditional VPN providers, BlockGuard allows you to deploy and connect to your own VPN server.

You only pay for the VPN time you use, making it perfect for quick tasks like checking news or streaming.

Our easy-to-use product can bring new users into the ecosystem, expanding the provider network and ultimately enriching the diversity of our service.
